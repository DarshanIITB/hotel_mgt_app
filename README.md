## Web Nominee Assignment
<hr/>

This application is built using MERN stack.
<b>Mongo DB</b> for database management, 
<b>Express.js</b> and Node.js for server runtime, 
and <b>React.js</b> for front-end development.

For the sake of simplicity I've used few modules at places.

At this stage, the application has following features included:
<ul>
<li>User registration and authentication</li>
<li>Date filter for room availability</li>
<li>Room booking</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
